## 2019-08-19 - Add basic Windows support
- Added a set of Server 2012 R2 facts
- Added a fact collector beaker job so that we don't have to wait for GCE
-
## 2019-03-11 - Add 'augeasversion' fact to all fact sets
- More modules are starting to need the 'augeasversion' fact so it was added to
  all fact sets for reference.

## 2018-10-25 - Add ssh_host_keys custom fact - 2.2.0
- Added a 'ssh_host_keys' custom fact to support the new fact that ships with

## 2018-03-08 - Add OracleLinux 6 and 7 factssets - 2.1.0
- Added factsets for OracleLinux 6 and 7
- Updated the fact collection Vagrantfile and scripts to handle non-GCE
  environments properly

## 2017-08-02 - Fix and normalize factsets - 2.0.1
The GCE-derived RHEL facts broke some spec tests due to changes in the
fqdns & IP addresses, which had been standardized as foo.example.com /
10.0.2.15. Additionally, the data structure from all CFacter (3.x) facts
was in an unusable format, and the data for some unsupported operating
systems and facter versions had gone stale.

To correct these issues, this patch:
  - Normalizes all data to include standard facterdb values
  - Corrects the data structure in facter 3.x factsets
  - Removes unsupported OSes (fedora) and Facter versions (3.1, 3.2)
  - Adds spec tests to check all factsets for structure and normalization

NOTE: It isn't possible to permanently set the fqdn or hostname of a GCE
VM(†), and temporarily changing them didn't affect all the facts. So
for the time being, the data structures are scrubbed back into place
using the gce_scrub_data.rb script.

- Added CFacter facts for all supported PE and SIMP versions
- `Vagrantfile` now uses official CentOS boxes from Atlus
- Updated scripts to collect facts for all
- `on_supported_os` is now smart enough to avoid facterdb crashes by only

  data that has been recorded for SIMP (avoids facterdb crashes)

  - **NOTE:** RHEL7 will not collect facts without a license
